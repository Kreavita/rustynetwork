# rustynetwork
Basic multi-layer perceptron model in Rust trained on the MNIST dataset

## Usage

To Use the MNIST Model, just build and run project with `cargo run --release`, then head to `http://localhost:80` and start training the model. By increasing batch size from 5 to 256 sizes, about 10-15 training runs and an alpha of about 1.5 - 2.5, over 96% Accuracy on the test data can be achieved.
